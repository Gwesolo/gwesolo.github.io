So I'm still getting to grips with using this github page as my new blogging platform and am still in the process of trying to make it look half decent. I've been referring back to [Web Design in 4 minutes](http://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/) for most of the basic layout improvements and browsing [Unsplash](http://www.unsplash.com) for some nice header imagery. I'm planning on writing a new 'about me' page that will be significantly updated and make me sound like less of a noob and building some kind of gallery for the portfolio page that may display my favourite email builds, freecodecamp projects and other projects. I also plan on cutting down the amount of blogging, as my weekly posts on my old blog had slowly become a bit forced and a bit of a ramble, so I may just try for a fortnightly update from now on.
