So it looks like I let myself get sidetracked and neglected the work still needed on this site. I've been focusing my attention on the Upskill full stack course I've mentioned before and I think it's because I'm starting to understand Rails and not just that, but also actually enjoying learning about it too. I've decided that Rails is going to be a focus of mine from here on out and will hopefully create some more projects in the future. I'm currently sitting at 75% completion of the course and then I'll spend some time making sure this portfolio is finished and looking a bit nicer. 
 
I've also got a good chance at work to branch out and learn some new things thanks to our team getting a new Head of Tech. He is really keen on getting us doing more than just email and I couldn't be happier. We've even been allocated time each week specifically for learning and development. So I could use that time to get more Rails stuff done or we'll pick a JS oriented framework and all get stuck into that. Very exciting times ahead!
