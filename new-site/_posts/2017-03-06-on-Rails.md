This site is still in progress and coming along nicely, debating wether to start using a Bootstrap UI kit to improve on the default look and feel. Also wanting to make sure my Codepen projects and email builds are all in order before adding them onto here. I'm also going to start adding a few blog posts about some of my Kinetic email builds, going over the build process, the inner workings and any issues. I feel this will be good for me to go over those builds again and keep the techniques fresh.

Away from here I've really stepped up the Ruby on Rails Upskill course and finally starting working on the actual main project. Building the blog starter project was incredibly simple and was pretty much complete with just a few console commands, I may go back to it and improve the visuals of it, once I know what I'm doing and eventually pop it on the portfolio. Really looking forward to delving deeper into the Rails framework, seeing what it can do and what paths it may open up for me.
