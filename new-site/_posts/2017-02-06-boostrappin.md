After much struggling with basic layouts and trying to do things in a 'non-email' way, I've decided to just use [Bootstrap](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) to improve things and make my life easier and it's already looking better. I'm going to focus on getting this site up and running to a decent standard as my new 'out of work' project before trying to get back into Angular or Ruby on Rails. It's funny I mention this change in focus as I'll be going on holiday soon and won't be touching anything code related at all!

Hopefully the addition of Bootstrap will aid me in creating a banging Gallery/Portfolio area and I'll pull my finger out to update the 'about me' page with a more current version of what I do, how I got myself here and what I would like to achieve.
