Large six part email campaign to help parents better understand and identify the risks to children being online. Each of the template would dynamically pull in one of the weekly subjects targeting parents with children in one of three age brackets. Accompanying these email templates were also a batch of landing pages that could be used by parents to help them and their children talk about the potential dangers online and how to deal with them.
