Different take on the carousel used in the IKEA build. This slider carousel has more of a 'standard' web behaviour, allowing the user to scroll left and right through a selection of 4 articles, on mobile views the slider shrinks down to only display a single article. Unsupported environments would display the articles in a 2x2 stack on desktop and single stack on mobile.
