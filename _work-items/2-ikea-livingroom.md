Part of the 2016 Festive campaign this was my first ever kinetic (interactive) email build. Three tabs displayed below the hero image would allow the user to control the carousel and switch between three slides displaying different content. The carousel was targeted for webkit devices only and was built to display correctly across all 3 iPhone breakpoints (5, 6 & 6+ at the time). A fallback template was also created, featuring a mix of content from the kinetic slides and would be displayed on all unsupported environments.
